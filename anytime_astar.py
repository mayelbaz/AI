class AnytimeAStar(GraphProblemSolver):
    """
    This class implements a variation of the Anytime A* search algorithm.
    We execute (weighted) AStar for multiple values of `w` (=`heuristic_weight`) in a "binary-search-way" over `w`,
     and look for the best solution we can find using a limited number of expanded states for each AStar execution.
    Performs a binary search over the values [0.5, 0.95]. As always, the binary search has two bounds maintained during
     the search: low bound & high bound. The low bound means "a solution could not be found (under the #expanded-states
      constrains) for this value of w and for lower ones". The high bound means "a solution has been found for this
      value of w".
    Each iteration we perform an (weighted) AStar execution where w is the mid point (between low & high bounds) and
     update the bounds correspondingly to keep the bounds-invariant satisfied.
    This way we finds a "minimal" value of `w` for which the AStar finds a solution (for the given problem) under the
     #expanded-states constraint.
    We keep iterating until the delta between the low & high bounds gets tiny enough.
    Finally, we return the best solution found during the search, INDEPENDENTLY with the value of `w`.
    Note that the #expands is not necessarily monotony decreasing with the value of `w`, hence we don't really find the
     minimal value of `w` for which AStar stops (there actually might be two values w1<w2 such that the AStar finds
     a solution (constrained to max_nr_states_to_expand_per_iteration) using w1 but it does not find a solution
     (again, constrained to max_nr_states_to_expand_per_iteration) using w2).
